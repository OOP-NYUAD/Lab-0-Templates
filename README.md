# Lab 0 - NYUAD Object Oriented Programming using C++

Welcome to the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) lab homework assignment in C++. This assignment aims to achieve the below two objectives:
- **Objective 1:** Help you understand the concept of code organization and best practices through the use of GitHub and Github Classrooms
- **Objective 2:** This assignment is designed to help you practice and apply the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in C++. Below are the exercises you'll be working on:

## Exercise 1: Hello World Program

- **Objective:** Write a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++.

## Exercise 2: Arithmetic Operations Menu

- **Objective:** Design a software that prints a menu for the user to select an arithmetic operation ('a' for addition, 's' for subtraction, 'm' for multiplication, and 'd' for division). The software should prompt the user for two numbers and perform the selected arithmetic operation. If the user chooses any other character, it should print "Invalid selection."

## Exercise 3: Factorial Calculation

- **Objective:** Write a program to find the factorial of a number using a loop.

## Exercise 4: Fibonacci Number Calculation

- **Objective:** 
  - A: Write a function to compute the Fibonacci number of a non-negative integer.
  - B: Write a function that "returns" more than one value. The specific functionality of this function is not important for the assignment.

## Exercise 5: File Analysis

- **Objective:** Write a program that counts the number of characters, words, and lines in a file. Words should be separated by spaces, tabs, or carriage return characters. The file name should be entered by the user.

## Exercise 6: Matrix Transposition

- **Objective:** Write a program to take the transpose of a matrix and store the result in a new matrix. The function prototype for transposition should be:

  ```cpp
  void transpose(int mat[][MaxDim], int mat_rows, int mat_cols, int transpose[][MaxDim])
  ```
  You can assume that `MaxDim` is greater than `mat_rows` and `mat_cols`.

## Exercise 7: Sorting an Array

- **Objective:** Write a C++ program to sort a one-dimensional data set in ascending order.

## Exercise 8: Mean and Standard Deviation

- **Objective:** Write a program to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a one-dimensional data set with 'n' entries.

## Instructions

1. Set-up your GitHub Classrooms work environment by following the instructions in the file: [Getting Started with GitHub Classrooms](https://github.com/OOP-NYUAD/Lab-0-Templates/blob/main/Getting%20Started%20with%20GitHub%20Classrooms.pdf) 
2. Add code to the existing C++ template files for each exercise and implement the code for that exercise within the respective file.
3. Ensure that each program is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of the code, key variables, and any important logic.
4. Test your programs thoroughly to ensure they meet the requirements of each exercise.
5. Once you've completed all exercises, push your changes to your own remote repository and submit the repository URL as your homework assignment.

Happy coding! If you have any questions or need clarification on any exercise, feel free to ask your instructor or teaching assistant.
